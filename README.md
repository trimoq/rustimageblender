[POC] Blending lots of images in a speedy fashion

This is a POC to blend lots of images, since imagemagic was only capable of blending about 15 images in one step on my laptop.

To build the project, run `cargo build --release` in the project directory. Dont forget the release flag, otherwise you will be disappointed.
